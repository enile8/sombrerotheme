# [Sombrero Theme for WordPress](http://www.sombrerotheme.com)

An easy to use lightwieght development theme.

Sombrero is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It uses some of the
best practices implemented by many of the top projects around the 
web from HTML5 Boilerplate, Blueprint CSS, Eric Meyer, Nathan Smith,
and many more that help out with those projects.

This is just a start on this theme, I plan to add more to it over time 
so that it will be easier for many to use and customize. I plan to
add a default theme options page that can easily be included and used
within the theme, as well as some base less and sass stylesheets.

##Quick start

* Clone the git repo 
`git clone git://github.com/enile8/sombrerotheme.git` - or 
[download it](https://github.com/enile8/sombrerotheme/zipball/master)
* Just upload it and activate it like any other WordPress theme
